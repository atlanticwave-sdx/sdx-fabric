AtlanticWave SDX Cross-Domain Orchestration and Provisioning for Facilities and R&amp;E Networks user interfaces with the SDXLib in Fabric Jupyter Notebook

This notebook experiment emphasizes the building of Layer 2 VPNs and the use of Fabric Facility Ports for network orchestration and provisioning across domains. It shows the integration of SDX Lib with the SDX Controller by using token-based authentication, closing the security gap and promoting safe communication between SDX Lib and the SDX Controller.

# Main objectives:
Use facility ports to enable connectivity and guarantee flawless coordination of SDX resources across several Major Facilities.

JWT tokens ensure safe communication between the SDX Library and the SDX Controller. The Fabric Credential Manager guarantees only allowed requests by helping keep and retrieve tokens and ensuring their availability.
 
## Creation of Layer 2 VPNs:

Create and control Layer 2 VPNs to guarantee safe data flow and enable cross-domain communications.

## Overview of an Experiment Context: 

Essential in SDX orchestration, the Facility Port provides a safe, logical connection point for SDX resources. 

Fabric Facility Ports help SDX Lib coordinate networks effectively and securely by allowing resource management across domains.

## Layer 2 Virtual Private Network: Configuration

The experiment shows Layer 2 VPN configuration and setup, thereby verifying that SDX Lib can efficiently interface with the SDX Controller for building and maintaining these VPNs.
